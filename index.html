       <h5>JavaScript Calculator</h5>

            <p>
                This calculator has been developed by Claud Watari 
                in partial fulfillment of the requirements for acceptance 
                into the Andela Kigali cycle 10 bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following receipt of the challenge instructions, 
                implementation of this calculator has been completed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                The calculator uses submit button for the keys, 
                both input and operational.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top is a div contained in a div, and set to occupy
                both the horizontal and vertical space available from the parent div, which covers roughly 
                70% of the viewport.
            </p>
            <p>
                This div has been given a css style of text align, which causes the displayed
                numbers to be on the right of the display. However, the result, 
                which also contains a logic of the operation, is absolutely positioned to 
                display at the bottom of the display area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every input key except for the number inputs, has an attribute of data-value, 
                which helps the javascript 
                identify which button has been clicked, and its function.
            </p>

            <button id = "moreDocumentationToOne">Read More&hellip;</button>
        </div>
        
        <div class="documentation-content d-cf">
            <span class="close">&times;</span>
            <p>
                There are three span elements within the display, each holds the operation values.
                The top span holds the first value, the second span holds the operation sign
                while the last span holds the last value.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the CE button is clicked, it checks whether
                there are any inputs to clear.
                If there are none, it displays a "All Clear" message.
                Otherwise it displays a "Clear Entries" message.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the equal button is clicked,
                it checks that there are valid inputs for calculation.
                It then checks the value in the first span element 
                and whether it is a decimal. It checks the sign in the second span 
                and finally the value in the last span and whether it has a decimal.
            </p>
            <p>
                It uses the operation sign to compute the values. For example,
                if the sign is an addition, denoted by +, it adds the first value with the second value.
                Eg, if the first value is 4 and the second value is 7, with an addition sign,
                it adds 4 and 7 and returns 11.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operation symbols have a data-value attribute which is checked by the JavaScript 
                to understand what the computation type will be.
            </p>

            <button id = "moreDocumentationToSecond">Read More&hellip;</button>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-content d-cs">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
            <p>
                The solution, along with the logic of the problem are shown in the bottom left 
                of the display div.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the equal sign is clicked, it replaces the first value with the answer from 
                the last computation for ease of further calculation. This is only to allow 
                for ease of more calculation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not worry, your original problem is to be seen at the bottom left of the display,
                colored green.
